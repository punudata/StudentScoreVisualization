# Student Score Data Visualization

This project involves the visualization of student scores using various charts and diagrams to gain insights into the performance and distribution of scores.

## Introduction

This project focuses on visualizing student scores using various charts and diagrams, aiming to provide insights into their performance and score distribution. By employing different visualization techniques such as count plots, box plots, heat maps, and pie charts, we can effectively analyze and interpret the data to understand trends, patterns, and correlations among different subjects and categories.

## Features

- Visualize student scores using various chart types.
- Analyze the distribution of scores.
- Identify trends and patterns in student performance.
- Compare scores across different subjects or time periods.
